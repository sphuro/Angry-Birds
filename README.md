# Angry Birds
___
Angry Birds is a popular puzzle video game. It has a simple story: the pigs stole the birdsâ€™ eggs, so the birds try
to get them back. In every level, the player uses a slingshot to launch the birds at the pigs that are standing on
buildings made of blocks. Each level gives the player a line of birds; the bird sitting on the slingshot is launched
when the player pulls the bird back. The bird behind it jumps up, and it is the next bird to be launched.
When a bird is launched, it can hit the buildings and make the blocks break. This can make the pigs fall
and disappear. The bird can also hit the pig itself to destroy it. The player has to destroy all the pigs in the
map to unlock another level.
